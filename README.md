# Spotify Mood Analytics

A Tableau data visualization exploring how **energy**, **tempo**, and **listener engagement** vary across Spotify mood clusters.

This project combines data analysis and visual storytelling to understand how different musical moods (e.g., *Chill / Acoustic*, *Emotional / Mellow*, *Energetic / Upbeat*) influence listener behavior and popularity on Spotify.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Analyze and visualize patterns in Spotify tracks to uncover how energy, tempo, and other features shape musical moods.
- **Data:** Spotify Audio Features Dataset (via Spotify API)
- **Techniques:** Clustering (Mood grouping) and interactive dashboard design
- **Key Insights:**
  - *Energetic / Upbeat* songs tend to dominate popularity and loudness.
  - *Chill / Acoustic* tracks score highest in acousticness but lower in energy.
  - *Emotional / Mellow* clusters bridge the two extremes — moderate energy, higher valence balance.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau** — interactive data visualization  
- **Python** — preprocessing, clustering, and feature calculations    
- **GitHub** — project versioning and documentation

## Why It Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean and transform real data into insights  
- Use **data visualization to communicate complex patterns clearly**  
- Combine **analytical thinking with design** for storytelling impact
